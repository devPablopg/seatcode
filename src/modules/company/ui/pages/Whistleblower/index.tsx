              <h1>Whistleblower Channels.</h1>
              <p>
                SEAT:CODE advocates for a corporate compliance culture, binding
                itself by both domestic and international legislation, and by
                internal regulations of the Company and the Volkswagen Group.
                For this reason, we make available to employees, business
                partners and third parties, the following points of contact:
              </p>
              <h3>Our Whistleblower System</h3>
              <p>
                Complying with statutory regulations and internal rules and the
                principles laid down in our Code of Conduct and the Code of
                Conduct for Business Partners, has top priority at SEAT:CODE.
                The success of our company is based on Integrity and Compliance.{" "}
                <strong>
                  To meet these standards, it is important to learn of potential
                  employee or supplier misconduct and to put a stop to it.
                </strong>{" "}
                Therefore, the SEAT Analysis Office together with the Central
                Investigation Office at Volkswagen - hereinafter the
                Investigation Office - operates an independent, impartial and
                confidential Whistleblower System.
              </p>
              <p>
                A key pillar of our Whistleblower System is the principle of
                procedural fairness. It also guarantees the greatest possible
                protection for whistleblowers, persons implicated and employees
                contributing to the investigation of reported misconduct.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                This also includes offering opportunities for anonymous
                reporting and communication. We assure not to perform any steps
                in order to identify anonymous whistleblowers, who do not misuse
                our Whistleblower System. Retaliation of whistleblowers and all
                persons who contribute to investigations at SEAT:CODE will not
                be tolerated. Persons implicated are presumed innocent until the
                violation is proven. Investigations will be conducted with the
                utmost confidentiality. The information will be processed in a
                fair, fast and protected process.
              </p>
              <h3>How do we process your report?</h3>
              <p>
                The employees at the Investigation Office examine every report
                for potential misconduct by Group employees thoroughly and
                follow it up systematically. First, you will get a confirmation
                of receipt. The Investigation Office then assesses your report.
                This includes gathering facts particularly from the
                whistleblower. Only if this initial evaluation shows grounds for
                suspicion of a violation an investigation by a dedicated
                Investigating Unit will be started. Afterwards, the results of
                the investigation will be assessed by the Investigation Office
                and appropriate measures will be recommended. Information about
                the status and the outcome of the procedure will be given to you
                without undue delay.
              </p>
              <p>
                Potential violations of the Code of Conduct for Business
                Partners by suppliers, including serious risks and violations of
                human rights and environment by direct and indirect suppliers,
                can also be reported to the Investigation Office - as well as
                reports requiring otherwise immediate action. The Investigation
                Office will inform the responsible departments, who will process
                the issue accordingly. This particularly includes taking the
                necessary measures to minimize or end violations and/or risks.
